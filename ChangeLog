18 March 2016 -- Evocosm 5.0.0

  * CHANGE: Removed non-BSD license
  
  * CHANGE: Reorganized code for cleaner distro.
  
  * CHANGE: Began modernized of on pre-C++11/14 C++ code; still more to do.
  
  * CHANGE: Improved example code, simplified naming
  
  * CHANGE: Cleaned code to compile under -Wall with gcc.
  
  * CHANGE: Eliminated dependancies on my other libraries.

1 July 2011
    Evocosm 4.0.0

  * CHANGE: Switched to Simplified BSD (FreeBSD) license for Open Source users.

  * CHANGE: Major code cleanup amd simplification. Nearly every class has changed
            in some way, and the library is no longer compatible with previous
            versions. Nearly every single class has been change din some manner
            to streamline and clarify the code.

  * CHANGE: Some classes renamed; for example, simple_fsm is now simple_machine,
            and fsm_tools are now machine_tools.

  * CHANGE: There is now one population and one set of fitness landscapes per
            evocosm. This vastly simplifies the library, and multiple intercating
            populations can still be simultaed internal to user code.

  * CHANGE: New stats class to perform simple statsitical analysis on populations.

  * CHANGE: Fitness scalers now use the stats class when appropriate.

  * NEW:    New example programs, including:

            * Extended function optimizer engine
            * Prisoner's Dilemma using state machines

20 November 2009
    Evocosm 3.4.0

  * CHANGE: Updated to GPL 3

  * CHANGE: Reporter class template renamed analyzr to clarify its purpose,
            which is to analyze a generation to see what state the population
            is in.

  * CHANGE: Listener class purpose clarfified: It is responsible for responding
            to events, which usually means updating a user interface. Added a
            "verbosty" setting as well.

  * CHANGE: The function optimizer is now part of the library itself

  * ADDED:  New example/test program for the function optimizer

  * FIX:    Minor clean-up in OpenMP support

21 January 2009
    Evocosm 3.3.1

  * FIX:    Removed bit-rot from Autotools files

17 July 2008
    Evocosm 3.3.0

  * NEW:    OpenMP support for fitness testing loop; it had been
            in the code previously, but not officially supported
            until now.

12 September 2006
    Evocosm 3.2.0

  * CHANGE: Updated to reflect the new Brahe library's random
            number generators. This includes encapsulating the
            PRNG in a class.

  * CHANGE: Moved the validator code from Coyotl (now defunct)
            into Evocosm.

    CHANGE: Comment and code clean-up

Old ChangeLog information lost prior to this version.
