I'm fascinated by machine learning through the evolutionary 
discovery of algorithms; I've also discovered some interesting 
ways to use genetic algorithms for testing software. As such, 
I write a number of different kinds of evolutionary algorithms, 
all of which follow certain patterns. And when I see patterns, 
I see the need for a framework â€” thus was born Evocosm, a 
collection of tools for creating a wide variety of evolutionary 
algorithms.

Evocosm is a set of classes for abstracting the fundamental 
components of an evolutionary algorithm. You'll find a general 
discussion below, and complete API documentation via the links
at left. The distribution includes two complete evolutionary 
algorithms: a generic function optimizer and an Iterated 
Prisoner's Dilemma.

My goal is to provide portable code for experimentation and 
demonstration. I've no interest in language wars. Trying to be 
everything to everyone will keep me from every finishing even a 
single project. For now, Evocosm is a C++ project.

Detailed documentation can be generated using Doxygen.

As always, I'm interested in your comments.
